To be documented, but unit test shows how to use it. 






* ``slist(type)`` declares all data structure to handle a sorted list composed of items. The type of item is user defined but must be a single word.
```c
struct my_struct {
	/* some declaration */
};
typedef struct my_struct my_struct;

slist(my_struct);
```
